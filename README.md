# Kimai Assignment

## Overview
Below are theree possible ways to deploy Kimai application in Docker container:
1. **Docker Compose** - Best for local or small deployments.
2. **AWS ECS (Fargate or EC2)** - Best for managed container deployment.
3. **Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS, or self-hosted)** - Best for scaling and high availability.

---

## Option 1: Docker Compose (Best for local or small deployments)
### **Architecture**
- **Host Machine** (EC2 instance, VM, or bare metal server)
- **Docker Daemon** (Runs containers)
- **Docker Compose** (Orchestrates multi-container applications)
- **Kimai Container** (Application service)
- **database Container** (Database service)
- **Reverse Proxy (NGINX)** (Optional, for SSL and routing)

### **Pros**
- Easy to set up and manage.
- Suitable for small teams or internal use.
- Minimal overhead and straightforward debugging.

### **Cons**
- Lacks scalability and high availability.
- No built-in load balancing.

---

## Option 2: AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)
### **Architecture**
- **AWS ECS Cluster** (Managed container orchestration)
- **Fargate or EC2 launch type**
- **Kimai Task** (Containerized application)
- **database on RDS** (Managed database service)
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** (For routing and SSL termination)

### **Pros**
- Fully managed by AWS, reducing operational overhead.
- Easier to scale compared to Docker Compose.

### **Cons**
- Limited flexibility compared to Kubernetes.
- More AWS dependency.

---

## Option 3: Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS, or Self-hosted)
### **Architecture**
- **Kubernetes Cluster** (Managed via EKS, GKE, AKS, or self-hosted)
- **Kimai Deployment** (Runs in pods)
- **RDS** (Database backend)
- **Persistent Volumes (EFS)** (For database storage)
- **Ingress Controller** (For traffic routing)

### **Pros**
- Highly scalable and available.
- Supports complex deployments and auto-healing.
- Suitable for enterprise environments.

### **Cons**
- Higher complexity and operational overhead.
- Requires Kubernetes knowledge.

### **Use Case**
- Best for large-scale production deployments that require resilience and flexibility.
